<h1 align="center">Your hello world in Murder Engine!</h1>

Welcome to this fantastic experience that is trying out your very first game with the Murder Engine.

### How to build it?
We _should_ have (at one point) more documentation explaining the onboarding process of [creating a new project](https://github.com/isadorasophia/murder) with Murder. The main purpose of this project is to serve as a baseline when quickly starting with a fresh new game on Murder Engine.

**\> _Terminal_**

```bash
cd src/HelloMurder.Editor
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**\> _Visual Studio_**

Open `HelloMurder.sln` on Visual Studio 2022, set `HelloMurder.Editor` as startup project and hit F5. ðŸŽ‰

### How do I play the game?
You can either press **F5** in the editor or switch the startup project to `HelloMurder`. And that's it!
